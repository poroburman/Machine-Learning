# Regression-Models

**This repository stores all the diiferent regression models which I have practiced in Python and R**.    

1. Support_Vector_Regression: this project is meant to verify the salary of a potential employee in his/ her previous company. We
                              will use support vector regression model to learn from the position salary dataset of the potential
                              employee's previous company and predict whether the potential employee earned 150k salary as a regional
                              manager. This project has following files:
                              - Position_Salaries.csv : dataset of poosition and salaries of employees of a company
                              - Support_Vector_Regression.ipynb : Python script for analysis.

2. Data_pre_processing: This project sets up the data pre-processing template for any Machine Learning model. This project involves the 
                         following files:
                         - Data.csv : dataset of 10 customers and whether they bought the ratil company's product or not.
                         - Data_pre_processing.R : R script for analysis
                         - Data_pre_processing.ipynb : Python script for analysis  
      
3. Simple_Linear_Regression: This project uses Simple Linear Regression to predict the Salary of an employee, based upon his experience.
                              - Salary_data.csv : dataset consists of employees from a company with their experiences and Salaries information.
                              - Simple_Linear_Regression.R - R script for analysis
                              - Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb - Python script for analysis.
