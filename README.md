# Regression-Models

**This repository stores all the diiferent regression models which I have practiced in Python and R**.    

1. Multiple_Linear_Regression: the dataset consists the profit statement for 50 companies and various additional variables associated with.   
                                those companies. This script is meant to develop a model where we can predict as to which
                                particular variable(s) contribute most towards the profit of those companies and which company is most profitable.   
                                This project has following files:
                                - 50_Startups.csv : dataset of thr profit statement of 50 companies.   
                                - Multiple_Linear_Regression.ipynb : Python script for analysis.   
                                - Multiple_Linear_Regression.pdf : Rmd knitted pdf file.   
                                - Multiple_Linear_Regression.Rmd : Rmd script.   

1. Random_Forest_Regression: this project is meant to verify the salary of a potential employee in his/ her previous company. We
                              will use random forest regression model to learn from the position salary dataset of the potential
                              employee's previous company and predict whether the potential employee earned 150k salary as a regional
                              manager. This project has following files:    
                              - Position_Salaries.csv : dataset of position and salaries of employees of a company.   
                              - Random_Forest_Regression.ipynb : Python script for analysis.   
                              - Random_Forest_Regression.pdf : Rmd knitted pdf output.   
                              - Random_Forest_regression.Rmd : Rmd script.

1. Decision_Tree_Regression: this project is meant to verify the salary of a potential employee in his/ her previous company. We
                              will use decision tree regression model to learn from the position salary dataset of the potential
                              employee's previous company and predict whether the potential employee earned 150k salary as a regional
                              manager. This project has following files:    
                              - Position_Salaries.csv : dataset of position and salaries of employees of a company.   
                              - Decision_Tree_Regression.ipynb : Python script for analysis.   
                              - Decision_Tree_Regression.pdf : Rmd knitted pdf output.   
                              - Decision_tree_regression.Rmd : Rmd script.   

2. Support_Vector_Regression: this project is meant to verify the salary of a potential employee in his/ her previous company. We
                              will use support vector regression model to learn from the position salary dataset of the potential
                              employee's previous company and predict whether the potential employee earned 150k salary as a regional
                              manager. This project has following files:        
                              - Position_Salaries.csv : dataset of poosition and salaries of employees of a company    
                              - Support_Vector_Regression.ipynb : Python script for analysis.    
                              - Support_Vector_Regression.pdf : Rmd knitted pdf output.   
                              - Support_Vector_Regression.Rmd : Rmd script.   

3. Data_pre_processing: This project sets up the data pre-processing template for any Machine Learning model. This project involves the 
                         following files:    
                         - Data.csv : dataset of 10 customers and whether they bought the ratil company's product or not.    
                         - Data_pre_processing.R : R script for analysis.   
                         - Data_pre_processing.ipynb : Python script for analysis.     
      
4. Simple_Linear_Regression: This project uses Simple Linear Regression to predict the Salary of an employee, based upon his experience.    
                              - Salary_data.csv : dataset consists of employees from a company with their experiences and Salaries information.    
                              - Simple_Linear_Regression.R - R script for analysis.   
                              - Simple_Linear_Regression.ipynb - Python script for analysis.
